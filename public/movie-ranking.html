<h1>The Best Movies According to Liza</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Titanic told the story of two star crossed lovers from different social classes who fall in love on a doomed ship.
    The characters Rose and Jack had amazing chemistry and the story was well written. It incorporated historical events with amazing set decoration. 
</p>
<h3>Elvis</h3>
<p>This movie depicted Elvis from an angle of vulnerability and focused on his soft, kind human nature.
    His good looks and talent really shown through in his personality. Unlike the caricature of Elvis that we often see in Vegas impersonations, we see a human side 
    of Elvis full of pain and torture. 
</p>
<h3>A Man Called Otto</h3>
<p>Tom Hanks in one of his best performances yet showed a man struggling to deal with the loss of his wife. 
    Repeated attempts at suicide failed as his community surrounded him with love and affirmation. It is a touching movie
    that pulled at the heart strings.
